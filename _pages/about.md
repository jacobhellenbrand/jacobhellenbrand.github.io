## About Me

I'm a recent Computer Science and Mathematics graduate from Macalester College, now working as a System Design & Implementation Engineer at Reynolds Transfer & Storage in Sun Prairie, WI.

My work focuses on building integrated systems and automation solutions. I specialize in creating seamless connections between business platforms using REST APIs, custom applications, and workflow automation. I'm passionate about solving complex technical problems and building tools that make businesses more efficient.

During my time at Macalester, I was a student-athlete on the football team, earning Academic All-MIAC honors for three consecutive years. I balanced rigorous academics with athletic commitments, developing strong skills in time management, teamwork, and leadership.
