In my computational linear algebra course we were given the tasks of using knowledge we'd gained from the course to create our own report. Briefly towards the end of the course our professor Lori Zieglemeir presented facial recoginiton of cats using matrices. This was something my group and I thought was very interesting and wished to replicate the same thing through our own code creation and image collection of faces.
