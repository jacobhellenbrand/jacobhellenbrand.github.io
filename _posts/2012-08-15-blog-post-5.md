This was my capstone project for my Math major. It was a very cool project I got to make that intersected my interests of sports, math, computer science and data science. 

What I Created
======

For this project I wanted to look at if there was a correlation between player interactions and success of players. I ended up using this data set [here](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/nfl-big-data-bowl-2025). It was an awesome data set from a Kaggle/NFL competition that gave me a lot of freedom in what I wished to create. 

Once I had the data, I created Python code to clean and standarize my data into usable CSV's. After this I did some network visualizations in Gephi, as well as some player comparisons in RStudio. 

Everything that I used is downloadable in my Repo, see below.

Lastly, I wanted to attach the link to [my repo](https://github.com/jacobhellenbrand/NFL-In-Game-Player-Interaction-Network-Analysis){:target="_blank"} of the project. Just in case you would like to take a peak at the specific code I am running.
