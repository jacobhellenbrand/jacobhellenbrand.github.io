How I Made The Site
======

Here I wanted to attach the [Github Repo](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io){:target="_blank"} that I forked to create this site. 

I was able to create the site using a combination of Github hosting, Jekyll, and Ruby. Overall the experience was super easy and the hardest part is just filling everything with your own information. There's instructions github, and everything is free to do if you ever have hopes of creating your own site. 

The site itself also has a lot of other features that I am not currently using or displaying on the site, as well this is only one of many different templates that are available to be used. 


Helpful Resources
======
I wanted to also attach a youtube video that I used to help me get set up. Overall I thought this was very easy to follow and helped me get this working in less than an hour. Click [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lJhXJCUYCc){:target="_blank"} to check it out!


My Repo
======
Lastly, I wanted to attach the link to [my repo](https://github.com/jacobhellenbrand/jacobhellenbrand.github.io){:target="_blank"} of the site. Just in case you would like to take a peak at the specific code I am running.
