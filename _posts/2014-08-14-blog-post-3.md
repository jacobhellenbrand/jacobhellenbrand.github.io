Do you like tower defense games? Do you hate cats? This may be the game for your. My partner Redding and I created Aquam Contra Felis for our 128 final project. The game is based off of streams of cats going towards an end goal while towers shoot water at them to keep them away. 

Our Project
======
For this Redding and I created our game through Java. We had inspiration from the game Balloon Tower Defense. Our game incorporates increasing round difficulty, a monetary system for surviving rounds, upgrades to towers, and a life system to know when the game is over. The game itself actually gets pretty challenging, you have to be really strategic with tower placement and using your money. Below You can see an image of what some gameplay looks like, don't worry about cats on the white space. We made it so that they run away when they are shot rather than dying
