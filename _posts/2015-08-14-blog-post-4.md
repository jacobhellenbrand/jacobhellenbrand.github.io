Have you ever wondered if how the chicken crosses the road? Well we did too, thats why we decided to make a replica of the game Crossy Roads. This was a project I did for my Comp-127 course with two partners, Cat and Max

Our Game
======
We created the game in Java, utilizing kilt graphics. The game is based around a user using their arrow keys to move a chicken around obstacles and avoid cars to reach the highest score possible. The game has moving cars, different speed cars, randomly generated obstacles, cycle gameplay, and a cute chicken that hops around. This game was the first ever game I made and it's a lot of fun. 

My Repo
======
If you would like to try playing the game, I'll attach my repo [here](https://github.com/jacobhellenbrand/comp127-project-CrossyRoads){:target="_blank"}.
