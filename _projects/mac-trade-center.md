---

A full-stack web application built for the Macalester community to facilitate buying and selling items among students.

## Project Overview

The Mac Community Trade Center provides a platform where Macalester students can:

- **List Items**: Post items for sale with descriptions and photos
- **Browse Listings**: Search and filter available items
- **Connect**: Reach out to sellers within the campus community
- **Manage Posts**: Edit or remove listings as needed

## Technical Stack

- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript for a responsive user interface
- **Backend**: Google Firebase for authentication and database
- **Features**: Real-time updates, user authentication, image uploads

## Motivation

Campus communities often need a dedicated space for buying and selling items—textbooks, furniture, electronics, and more. This project provides that space specifically for Macalester students, making transactions safer and more convenient than general marketplaces.
