An exploration of artificial life through evolutionary simulation, examining how simple agents can develop complex behaviors over generations.

## Project Overview

This project simulates populations of artificial agents that:

- **Compete** for resources in a virtual environment
- **Reproduce** based on fitness criteria
- **Evolve** behaviors over multiple generations
- **Adapt** to environmental pressures

## Key Concepts

### Genetic Algorithms
Agents carry "genetic" information that influences their behavior. Successful agents are more likely to pass on their traits.

### Emergent Behavior
Complex behaviors emerge from simple rules—agents develop strategies without being explicitly programmed.

### Natural Selection
The simulation demonstrates Darwinian principles as populations adapt to their environment over time.

## Technical Details

- **Python**: Core simulation engine
- **RStudio**: Statistical analysis of evolutionary trends
- **Visualization**: Tracking population dynamics and behavior patterns

## Findings

The project demonstrates how evolution can produce sophisticated survival strategies from basic building blocks, providing insights into both biological evolution and optimization algorithms.
