I wrote this paper with two classmates for my differential equations class, exploring the mathematics behind groundwater flow.

## Background

We based our understanding on J. Tóth's seminal work "A Theoretical Analysis of Groundwater Flow in Small Drainage Basins" (1962), which established foundational principles for understanding subsurface water movement.

## Project Content

### Part 1: Theoretical Foundation

The first half of our paper explores:
- Tóth's equations and findings
- The application of Laplace's equation to groundwater systems
- Mathematical derivations of flow patterns

### Part 2: Numerical Simulations

In the second half, we created MATLAB visualizations showing:
- How groundwater flows around different obstacles
- Flow patterns into and out of various locations
- Different scenarios with varying boundary conditions
