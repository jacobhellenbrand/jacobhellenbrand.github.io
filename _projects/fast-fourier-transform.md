In my Algorithm Analysis course, we were given the task of choosing a famous algorithm to analyze, create example code, and present to the class.

## The FFT Algorithm

The Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) is one of the most important algorithms in computer science and signal processing. It efficiently computes the Discrete Fourier Transform, reducing the complexity from O(n²) to O(n log n).

## Project Components

- **Algorithm Analysis**: Breaking down the mathematical foundations
- **Complexity Study**: Understanding why FFT is so efficient
- **Implementation**: Creating working code examples
- **Applications**: Exploring real-world uses in signal processing, image compression, and more

## Key Insights

Understanding the FFT was greatly aided by my background in linear algebra and matrices. The algorithm's recursive divide-and-conquer approach demonstrates elegant algorithm design principles.
