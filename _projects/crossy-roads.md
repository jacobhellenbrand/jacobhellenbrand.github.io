A Java-based game inspired by the popular mobile game Crossy Road, built as part of my computer science coursework.

## Game Features

- **Classic Gameplay**: Navigate a character through obstacles
- **Dynamic Obstacles**: Cars, rivers, and other hazards
- **Scoring System**: Track progress and high scores
- **Graphics**: Custom sprites and animations

## Technical Implementation

This project demonstrates:

- **Object-Oriented Design**: Classes for characters, obstacles, and game logic
- **Game Loop**: Handling updates and rendering
- **Collision Detection**: Determining when the player hits obstacles
- **Event Handling**: Responding to player input

## Learning Outcomes

Building this game reinforced fundamental programming concepts including inheritance, polymorphism, and event-driven programming. It also provided hands-on experience with game development patterns.
