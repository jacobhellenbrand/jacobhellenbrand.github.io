Over a week, the Macalester football team and I got the opportunity to volunteer with NMDP (National Marrow Donation Program, formerly Be The Match).

## About NMDP

The National Marrow Donation Program plays a crucial role in connecting individuals diagnosed with blood cancer or other blood disorders with potential donors who have matching stem cells or bone marrow.

Finding a matching donor can be complex due to each individual's unique genetic makeup. NMDP has developed an extensive database of potential donors, making it more likely for patients to find a match.

## Our Role

We were connected to NMDP by Sonya, the chapter president for NMDP at Macalester and a Student Medical Assistant who works with the football team. She reached out to our coach giving us the opportunity to be involved.

Over two days, team members volunteered 6 hours going around campus informing people about NMDP and encouraging them to join the registry. We had an incredibly successful time, getting **146 students and professors to join**.

## Battle Born 90-Minute Challenge

As a fundraiser for NMDP, our head coach organized a 5K on campus. The event was designed to be achievable by everyone:

- One loop was 1.03 miles
- Participants left from the start every 30 minutes
- Focus on completing it together rather than competition

### Why "Battle Born"?

Team members held a 265-pound tire on their shoulders throughout the entire 5K distance. While rotating shifts, they held the tire in the air for the full distance and about 75 minutes of total time.

Overall, being able to dedicate time to support NMDP was an incredibly rewarding opportunity. Working alongside my team and knowing that our efforts are making a tangible impact has been truly fulfilling.
