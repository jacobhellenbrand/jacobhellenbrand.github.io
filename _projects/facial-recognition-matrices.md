In my computational linear algebra course, we were tasked with creating our own technical report using concepts from the course.

## Inspiration

Towards the end of the course, our professor Lori Ziegelmeier presented facial recognition of cats using matrices. This was something my group and I found fascinating and wanted to replicate using human faces.

## Project Overview

We implemented a facial recognition system from scratch using:

- **Eigenface Method**: Decomposing face images into principal components
- **Matrix Operations**: Applying linear algebra concepts to image processing
- **Custom Dataset**: Collecting and processing our own set of facial images

## Technical Details

The project demonstrates how linear algebra concepts like eigenvalues, eigenvectors, and matrix decomposition can be applied to real-world machine learning problems.
